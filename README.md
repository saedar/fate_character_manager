# Fate Character Manager

## Introduction

Personally tooling around with a Character Manager for the Fate Core RPG.

Each person at the table has a character they are embodying. Like any game, it has rules, structure and mechanics that define it. Similarly, each character is a collection of phrases, descriptors and statistics that help give it meaningful form in the game. The application serves as a digital repository for those characters, so you don't have to carry around a sheet of paper all the time.

## Usage

1. Run `git clone` for the repo.
2. Run `bundle install` from the application root.
3. Run `rails s` to start the application server.

For ease, seed data is provided for the default skill list from the Fate Core RPG.
To use, run `rake db:seed`.
